S'I\xe2\x80\x99m curious what readers (religious or not) wind up doing when you\xe2\x80\x99re frustrated by/or angry at someone. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ve just been reading\xc2\xa0Letters to a Beginner: On Giving One\xe2\x80\x99s Life To God\xc2\xa0by Abbess Thaisia of Leushino and she writes sharply against idle talk and gossip:It begins under the pretext of conversing, of discussing some business, but then we proceed imperceptibly to an altogether unnecessary, empty, and sinful conversation. \xc2\xa0Like a deeply-rooted infection, this sickness does not easily submit to healing. \xc2\xa0It has penetrated all layers of social and private life; it is active in people of every age and gender, every class and social position, and has not even spared monasteries.[...]And what great evil results from empty and idle conversations and gossip! \xc2\xa0Sometimes one heedlessly spoken word causes a whole storm of indignation and hatred. \xc2\xa0So even a word that was not ill-intentioned, one we counted as nothing, can strike a mortal sin, just as a small spark often turns into a great fire burning whole villages.I\xe2\x80\x99m just not always sure what I\xc2\xa0should be doing when I\xe2\x80\x99m frustrated. \xc2\xa0Sometimes I tell the whole story to a friend, but I usually don\xe2\x80\x99t feel better as a result. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be sympathized with (well, I want it a bit, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not what I most want-to-want), and especially not at the expense of the person who irritated me. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m more likely to get my friend to feel frustrated on my behalf and angry at the person I\xe2\x80\x99m angry at.But I don\xe2\x80\x99t\xc2\xa0want (or, if I\xe2\x80\x99m in a bad mood, want-to-want) to be angry, and I definitely don\xe2\x80\x99t want to contagiously spread my anger to others. \xc2\xa0What I really tend to need is someone to help me develop a little more compassion for the person I\xe2\x80\x99m teed off at, and then figure out if there\xe2\x80\x99s something I can do for the both of us. \xc2\xa0When a conversation doesn\xe2\x80\x99t help me move toward reconciliation, and makes the other person upset, too, I feel worse, not better.Alternatively, I can keep mum about the irritation (which isn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily unreasonable \xe2\x80\x94 when this happens, it\xe2\x80\x99s often a pretty minor thing), but I\xe2\x80\x99m not\xc2\xa0great at moving from resentment to\xc2\xa0caritas on my own, and there\xe2\x80\x99s something that feels a little dishonest about being privately angry and having\xc2\xa0no one know. \xc2\xa0Though that may be a weirder, modern thought, thinking the truest part of myself are my impulses, not the way I respond to them.What I actually tend to do is pull out this Orthodox prayer for enemies (immediately, on my phone, if necessary) and go through it:Lord Jesus Christ, Who didst command us to love our enemies, and those who defame and injure us, and to pray for them and forgive them; Who Thyself didst pray for Thine enemies, who crucified thee: grant us, we pray, the spirit of Christian reconciliation and meekness, that we may heartily forgive every injury and be reconciled with our enemies. Grant us to overcome the malevolence and offences of people with Christian meekness and true love of our neighbor. We further beseech Thee, O Lord, to grant to our enemies true peace and forgiveness of sins; and do not allow them to leave this life without true faith and sincere conversion. And help us repay evil with goodness, and to remain safe from the temptations of the devil and from all the perils which threaten us, in the form of visible and invisible enemies. Amen.I like having language I can rely on that starts by acknowledging my anger and moves from there to wishing real peace for the person who I\xe2\x80\x99m having a difficult time with.Plus, I like the juxtaposition of this \xe2\x80\x9cFor enemies\xe2\x80\x9d with what appears under that heading in the Half Blood Prince\xe2\x80\x99s potions book.I get to pick revenge or reconciliation, and the stakes are always high.\xc2\xa0Do you guys have any good alternatives?'

S'I got to hear Rod Dreher and Ken Myers (of the Mars Hill Audio Journal) discuss the Benedict Option this weekend at the Tocqueville Forum. \xc2\xa0At least 200 people turned out, so, when it came time for questions, I wanted to make sure to ask something that would help us all do something in the near term (rather than rely on Rod to make another visit to draw us all together again).I asked both speakers what they would recommend that people in the audience do now (either this week, or, if possible, this afternoon) that could be a good first step toward future BenOp projects, but also just good in itself. \xc2\xa0(To preclude the temptation that I\xe2\x80\x99m vulnerable to, too, I specified the action shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be \xe2\x80\x9cRead [X]\xe2\x80\x9c). \xc2\xa0Between the two of them, they came up with:Invite someone/a group to dinnerMemorize a poem (nourishing through arts)Adopt a prayer rule (simple is fine, but let it be rooted in some kind of tradition, rather than purely choose-your-own-adventure)I liked all of these, and 1 and 3 are ones that I do. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re nice because they\xe2\x80\x99re the start of a habit, but don\xe2\x80\x99t require an extraordinary effort to begin.My prayer rule, in case you\xe2\x80\x99re wondering, is Morning and Evening Office, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a little less stable than I\xe2\x80\x99d like at present. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ve pegged it to commutes before, but my working schedule doesn\xe2\x80\x99t allow it, so there\xe2\x80\x99s more ad hoc fitting it in (or missing it!) than I\xe2\x80\x99d like.A prayer rule touches on some of the stability/institutional character of the Benedict Option. \xc2\xa0It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t technically involve others, but it could if it\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of thing you can invite others into. \xc2\xa0For families, this is a little more straightforward, but people with housemates can see if others are interested, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve asked others to join me for my Evening Prayer practice at the end of alumni debates, on the way home from bars with friends, etc. \xc2\xa0Having a regular practice helps keep me on track, and also gives me something to be hospitable with.Choosing a prayer rule is the kind of challenge that can be derailed by the desire to get it\xc2\xa0right, and therefore put off beginning. \xc2\xa0In general, I think it makes sense to start with\xc2\xa0something (maybe even this evening, if you have a candidate in mind) and to revise as you go, if needed. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea to pick something you are pretty sure you can do, even if it means you\xe2\x80\x99re picking something that feels too small (an\xc2\xa0Anima Christi when you wake up and before bed?)I figure that I\xe2\x80\x99ll do a better job of reflecting on my prayer life when I\xe2\x80\x99m actually praying, because I have more opportunities to be attentive to God working in my life. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s a relationship, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t do much if I\xe2\x80\x99m pushing the other person out until I come up with a solution in isolation. So I\xe2\x80\x99d say just start somewhere, and assume you\xe2\x80\x99re picking something flawed, but that you\xe2\x80\x99ll work it out as you go. \xc2\xa0 To crib from\xc2\xa0Company, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s much better living it than looking at it.\xe2\x80\x9dBut that process of revising/discernment can be pretty stressful and self-conscious. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s often hard for me to know whether something I\xe2\x80\x99m trying isn\xe2\x80\x99t working out and I should move on or whether I should try to change myself to fit the practice. \xc2\xa0I noticed that both Rod and Ken referenced spiritual directors, and it\xe2\x80\x99s harder to pick up a prayer rule (or find your way into ascetic practices\xe2\x80\x93which they also recommended) without one.Eve Tushnet calls this the danger of \xe2\x80\x9cself abboting.\xe2\x80\x9dI talk about one part of this problem a little bit in the book, in the section on accountability. Lack of accountability was/is one of my own biggest struggles as a celibate layperson. It played a serious role in my drinking problem\xe2\x80\x93there was nobody to come home to, there was a possibility of\xc2\xa0privacy\xc2\xa0which was tempting and damaging. I think this is one reason that starting spiritual direction was so foundational to my recovery and eventual sobriety. I basically went out and got myself an abbot.One reason I\xe2\x80\x99m so high on the idea of people\xc2\xa0living with their parents/families of origin, or in a family household, is that it allows laypeople to be one another\xe2\x80\x99s abbots, to guide and watch over one another. It requires adherence to rules, sometimes-sacrificial consideration of others\xe2\x80\x99 needs, and a surrender of one\xe2\x80\x99s own comfort, preferences, and autonomy. Intentional community living, which gets a nice chapter in the book, is another way to attain some of the spiritual benefits of monastic life.In the absence of an abbot of my own, my approach tends to be a bit Miss Frizzle-ish: \xe2\x80\x9cTake chances, make mistakes, get messy!\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m willing to try a lot of small scale, temporary things and try to figure out what might be helpful, rather than try to plan out a really good idea and then commit. \xc2\xa0It helps a lot to be able to reach out to friends and learn from their experience and their knowledge of me (which can be more clear-eyed than my self knowledge).So, maybe the best thing to do today is to try out some kind of regular prayer (if you don\xe2\x80\x99t already) and to invite a friend to dinner in two weeks to catch up and kibbitz about what you\xe2\x80\x99re trying.\xc2\xa0'

S'I got to hear Rod Dreher and Ken Myers (of the Mars Hill Audio Journal) discuss the Benedict Option this weekend at the Tocqueville Forum. \xc2\xa0At least 200 people turned out, so, when it came time for questions, I wanted to make sure to ask something that would help us all do something in the near term (rather than rely on Rod to make another visit to draw us all together again).I asked both speakers what they would recommend that people in the audience do now (either this week, or, if possible, this afternoon) that could be a good first step toward future BenOp projects, but also just good in itself. \xc2\xa0(To preclude the temptation that I\xe2\x80\x99m vulnerable to, too, I specified the action shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be \xe2\x80\x9cRead [X]\xe2\x80\x9c). \xc2\xa0Between the two of them, they came up with:Invite someone/a group to dinnerMemorize a poem (nourishing through arts)Adopt a prayer rule (simple is fine, but let it be rooted in some kind of tradition, rather than purely choose-your-own-adventure)I liked all of these, and 1 and 3 are ones that I do. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re nice because they\xe2\x80\x99re the start of a habit, but don\xe2\x80\x99t require an extraordinary effort to begin.My prayer rule, in case you\xe2\x80\x99re wondering, is Morning and Evening Office, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a little less stable than I\xe2\x80\x99d like at present. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ve pegged it to commutes before, but my working schedule doesn\xe2\x80\x99t allow it, so there\xe2\x80\x99s more ad hoc fitting it in (or missing it!) than I\xe2\x80\x99d like.A prayer rule touches on some of the stability/institutional character of the Benedict Option. \xc2\xa0It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t technically involve others, but it could if it\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of thing you can invite others into. \xc2\xa0For families, this is a little more straightforward, but people with housemates can see if others are interested, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve asked others to join me for my Evening Prayer practice at the end of alumni debates, on the way home from bars with friends, etc. \xc2\xa0Having a regular practice helps keep me on track, and also gives me something to be hospitable with.Choosing a prayer rule is the kind of challenge that can be derailed by the desire to get it\xc2\xa0right, and therefore put off beginning. \xc2\xa0In general, I think it makes sense to start with\xc2\xa0something (maybe even this evening, if you have a candidate in mind) and to revise as you go, if needed. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea to pick something you are pretty sure you can do, even if it means you\xe2\x80\x99re picking something that feels too small (an\xc2\xa0Anima Christi when you wake up and before bed?)I figure that I\xe2\x80\x99ll do a better job of reflecting on my prayer life when I\xe2\x80\x99m actually praying, because I have more opportunities to be attentive to God working in my life. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s a relationship, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t do much if I\xe2\x80\x99m pushing the other person out until I come up with a solution in isolation. So I\xe2\x80\x99d say just start somewhere, and assume you\xe2\x80\x99re picking something flawed, but that you\xe2\x80\x99ll work it out as you go. \xc2\xa0 To crib from\xc2\xa0Company, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s much better living it than looking at it.\xe2\x80\x9dBut that process of revising/discernment can be pretty stressful and self-conscious. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s often hard for me to know whether something I\xe2\x80\x99m trying isn\xe2\x80\x99t working out and I should move on or whether I should try to change myself to fit the practice. \xc2\xa0I noticed that both Rod and Ken referenced spiritual directors, and it\xe2\x80\x99s harder to pick up a prayer rule (or find your way into ascetic practices\xe2\x80\x93which they also recommended) without one.Eve Tushnet calls this the danger of \xe2\x80\x9cself abboting.\xe2\x80\x9dI talk about one part of this problem a little bit in the book, in the section on accountability. Lack of accountability was/is one of my own biggest struggles as a celibate layperson. It played a serious role in my drinking problem\xe2\x80\x93there was nobody to come home to, there was a possibility of\xc2\xa0privacy\xc2\xa0which was tempting and damaging. I think this is one reason that starting spiritual direction was so foundational to my recovery and eventual sobriety. I basically went out and got myself an abbot.One reason I\xe2\x80\x99m so high on the idea of people\xc2\xa0living with their parents/families of origin, or in a family household, is that it allows laypeople to be one another\xe2\x80\x99s abbots, to guide and watch over one another. It requires adherence to rules, sometimes-sacrificial consideration of others\xe2\x80\x99 needs, and a surrender of one\xe2\x80\x99s own comfort, preferences, and autonomy. Intentional community living, which gets a nice chapter in the book, is another way to attain some of the spiritual benefits of monastic life.In the absence of an abbot of my own, my approach tends to be a bit Miss Frizzle-ish: \xe2\x80\x9cTake chances, make mistakes, get messy!\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m willing to try a lot of small scale, temporary things and try to figure out what might be helpful, rather than try to plan out a really good idea and then commit. \xc2\xa0It helps a lot to be able to reach out to friends and learn from their experience and their knowledge of me (which can be more clear-eyed than my self knowledge).So, maybe the best thing to do today is to try out some kind of regular prayer (if you don\xe2\x80\x99t already) and to invite a friend to dinner in two weeks to catch up and kibbitz about what you\xe2\x80\x99re trying.\xc2\xa0'

S'\xe2\x80\x94 1 \xe2\x80\x94A friend of mine is looking for good semi-pregnant Halloween costumes (she\xe2\x80\x99s not big enough to go as a globe, as she hoped). \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have that much to suggest (maybe you all have ideas for her?) but I do have a roundup of excellent parent-baby costumes. \xc2\xa0My favorite is the child as Max from\xc2\xa0Where the Wild Things Are, and his mom as his boat!\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 2 \xe2\x80\x94Also in the domain of, um,\xc2\xa0expressive things to do with your offspring: there\xe2\x80\x99s an annual reunion for people named after Paul William Bryant, a famous football coach in Alabama.\xe2\x80\x94 3 \xe2\x80\x94This first-person essay on fraternities is a more sober story about being swept up in college enthusiasm/identities:The great paradox of Greek life is that the people who are constantly pushing you, sometimes gently, sometimes not, to engage in behaviors that can kill you do not actually want you to die. When someone encourages you to drink yourself unconscious, then grabs a magic marker to draw a pair of open eyes on your comatose lids, ejaculating penises on your pallid cheeks, four-letter words on your clammy forehead, they do so believing that you will eventually wake up and have a good laugh at their work. No one does any of that while also believing that you are on the verge of death.\xe2\x80\x94 4 \xe2\x80\x94Communities can be formed in less intense, less dangerous circumstances. \xc2\xa0I like prefer the emotional rush of communal singing to that of shared danger, so I really enjoyed Audra Nakes\xe2\x80\x99s essay in Ethika Politka:\xc2\xa0Yet even most cities and regions that do exhibit strong local identities don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to have a culture of singing. I\xe2\x80\x99m not the only one who feels that something is missing. As I was writing this piece, someone in my parish young adult group invited all of us to his house to sing folk songs and spirituals and sent the repertoire in advance so that we could familiarize ourselves with the songs. My friend\xe2\x80\x99s organized effort underscores not only the lack of a singing culture in the United States, but also that the desire to sing together persists. No matter how much Americans value individualism, we\xe2\x80\x99re still social animals who long for outward expressions of communion with others, particularly those with whom we share a national or patriotic identity.\xe2\x80\x94 5 \xe2\x80\x94While we\xe2\x80\x99re speaking of singing and culture, I heartily recommend this Storify collecting my friend Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s tweets on how\xc2\xa0Hamilton\xc2\xa0does an unusually good job telling a war story:Artistic works about warfare in the past are usually really bad at conveying the heft of tactical planning. @HamiltonMusical nails it.\xe2\x80\x94 Ivan Plis (@ivanplis) September 22, 2015Read the whole thing here.\xe2\x80\x94 6 \xe2\x80\x94Hamilton\xc2\xa0is as much about how history gets told as it\xe2\x80\x99s about the specific story it\xe2\x80\x99s telling. \xc2\xa0In Japan, where the oral testimony of atomic bomb survivors has been tremendously important, younger people are trying to practically become a book,\xc2\xa0Fahrenheit\xc2\xa0451-style to keep the stories alive, after their tellers are dead.\xe2\x80\x9cThe denshosha are essentially putting themselves in the position of that person, so the survivor doesn\xe2\x80\x99t permanently disappear,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. They have an authority that comes with the survivor\xe2\x80\x99s blessing to be \xe2\x80\x9cheirs\xe2\x80\x9d to their stories, he said, and a mandate to keep finding audiences.

S'\xe2\x80\x94 1 \xe2\x80\x94A friend of mine is looking for good semi-pregnant Halloween costumes (she\xe2\x80\x99s not big enough to go as a globe, as she hoped). \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have that much to suggest (maybe you all have ideas for her?) but I do have a roundup of excellent parent-baby costumes. \xc2\xa0My favorite is the child as Max from\xc2\xa0Where the Wild Things Are, and his mom as his boat!\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 2 \xe2\x80\x94Also in the domain of, um,\xc2\xa0expressive things to do with your offspring: there\xe2\x80\x99s an annual reunion for people named after Paul William Bryant, a famous football coach in Alabama.\xe2\x80\x94 3 \xe2\x80\x94This first-person essay on fraternities is a more sober story about being swept up in college enthusiasm/identities:The great paradox of Greek life is that the people who are constantly pushing you, sometimes gently, sometimes not, to engage in behaviors that can kill you do not actually want you to die. When someone encourages you to drink yourself unconscious, then grabs a magic marker to draw a pair of open eyes on your comatose lids, ejaculating penises on your pallid cheeks, four-letter words on your clammy forehead, they do so believing that you will eventually wake up and have a good laugh at their work. No one does any of that while also believing that you are on the verge of death.\xe2\x80\x94 4 \xe2\x80\x94Communities can be formed in less intense, less dangerous circumstances. \xc2\xa0I like prefer the emotional rush of communal singing to that of shared danger, so I really enjoyed Audra Nakes\xe2\x80\x99s essay in Ethika Politka:\xc2\xa0Yet even most cities and regions that do exhibit strong local identities don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to have a culture of singing. I\xe2\x80\x99m not the only one who feels that something is missing. As I was writing this piece, someone in my parish young adult group invited all of us to his house to sing folk songs and spirituals and sent the repertoire in advance so that we could familiarize ourselves with the songs. My friend\xe2\x80\x99s organized effort underscores not only the lack of a singing culture in the United States, but also that the desire to sing together persists. No matter how much Americans value individualism, we\xe2\x80\x99re still social animals who long for outward expressions of communion with others, particularly those with whom we share a national or patriotic identity.\xe2\x80\x94 5 \xe2\x80\x94While we\xe2\x80\x99re speaking of singing and culture, I heartily recommend this Storify collecting my friend Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s tweets on how\xc2\xa0Hamilton\xc2\xa0does an unusually good job telling a war story:Artistic works about warfare in the past are usually really bad at conveying the heft of tactical planning. @HamiltonMusical nails it.\xe2\x80\x94 Ivan Plis (@ivanplis) September 22, 2015Read the whole thing here.\xe2\x80\x94 6 \xe2\x80\x94Hamilton\xc2\xa0is as much about how history gets told as it\xe2\x80\x99s about the specific story it\xe2\x80\x99s telling. \xc2\xa0In Japan, where the oral testimony of atomic bomb survivors has been tremendously important, younger people are trying to practically become a book,\xc2\xa0Fahrenheit\xc2\xa0451-style to keep the stories alive, after their tellers are dead.\xe2\x80\x9cThe denshosha are essentially putting themselves in the position of that person, so the survivor doesn\xe2\x80\x99t permanently disappear,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. They have an authority that comes with the survivor\xe2\x80\x99s blessing to be \xe2\x80\x9cheirs\xe2\x80\x9d to their stories, he said, and a mandate to keep finding audiences. Survivors often visit schools, for instance, something denshosha could do in their place.\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a very interesting experiment in forming and preserving collective memories,\xe2\x80\x9d Professor Kawanishi said.\xe2\x80\x94 7 \xe2\x80\x94Finally, here\xe2\x80\x99s the last of the pieces I wrote for DeSales media during the Papal visit: \xe2\x80\x9cEmbracing the Demands of Priesthood, and Demanding the Embrace of Priests\xe2\x80\x9dHis visit may inspire Catholics to be more demanding, in just the way he desires.
